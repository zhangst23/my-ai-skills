## Test Plan Template

```markdown
# A/B Test: [Name]

## Overview
- **Owner**: [Name]
- **Test ID**: [ID in testing tool]
- **Page/Feature**: [What's being tested]
- **Planned dates**: [Start] - [End]

## Hypothesis

Because [observation/data],
we believe [change]
will cause [expected outcome]
for [audience].
We'll know this is true when [metrics].

## Test Design

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Test type | A/B / A/B/n / MVT |
| Duration | X weeks |
| Sample size | X per variant |
| Traffic allocation | 50/50 |
| Tool | [Tool name] |
| Implementation | Client-side / Server-side |

## Variants

### Control (A)
[Screenshot]
- Current experience
- [Key details about current state]

### Variant (B)
[Screenshot or mockup]
- [Specific change #1]
- [Specific change #2]
- Rationale: [Why we think this will win]

## Metrics

### Primary
- **Metric**: [metric name]
- **Definition**: [how it's calculated]
- **Current baseline**: [X%]
- **Minimum detectable effect**: [X%]

### Secondary
- [Metric 1]: [what it tells us]
- [Metric 2]: [what it tells us]
- [Metric 3]: [what it tells us]

### Guardrails
- [Metric that shouldn't get worse]
- [Another safety metric]

## Segment Analysis Plan
- Mobile vs. desktop
- New vs. returning visitors
- Traffic source
- [Other relevant segments]

## Success Criteria
- Winner: [Primary metric improves by X% with 95% confidence]
- Loser: [Primary metric decreases significantly]
- Inconclusive: [What we'll do if no significant result]

## Pre-Launch Checklist

## Results Documentation Template

```markdown
# A/B Test Results: [Name]

## Summary
| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Test ID | [ID] |
| Dates | [Start] - [End] |
| Duration | X days |
| Result | Winner / Loser / Inconclusive |
| Decision | [What we're doing] |

## Hypothesis (Reminder)
[Copy from test plan]

## Results

### Sample Size
| Variant | Target | Actual | % of target |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Control | X | Y | Z% |
| Variant | X | Y | Z% |

### Primary Metric: [Metric Name]
| Variant | Value | 95% CI | vs. Control |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Control | X% | [X%, Y%] | — |
| Variant | X% | [X%, Y%] | +X% |

**Statistical significance**: p = X.XX (95% = sig / not sig)
**Practical significance**: [Is this lift meaningful for the business?]

### Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Control | Variant | Change | Significant? |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|--------------|
| [Metric 1] | X | Y | +Z% | Yes/No |
| [Metric 2] | X | Y | +Z% | Yes/No |

### Guardrail Metrics

| Metric | Control | Variant | Change | Concern? |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| [Metric 1] | X | Y | +Z% | Yes/No |

### Segment Analysis

**Mobile vs. Desktop**
| Segment | Control | Variant | Lift |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| Mobile | X% | Y% | +Z% |
| Desktop | X% | Y% | +Z% |

**New vs. Returning**
| Segment | Control | Variant | Lift |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| New | X% | Y% | +Z% |
| Returning | X% | Y% | +Z% |

## Interpretation

### What happened?
[Explanation of results in plain language]

### Why do we think this happened?
[Analysis and reasoning]

### Caveats
[Any limitations, external factors, or concerns]

## Decision

**Winner**: [Control / Variant]

**Action**: [Implement variant / Keep control / Re-test]

**Timeline**: [When changes will be implemented]

## Learnings

### What we learned
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]

### What to test next
- [Follow-up test idea 1]
- [Follow-up test idea 2]

### Impact
- **Projected lift**: [X% improvement in Y metric]
