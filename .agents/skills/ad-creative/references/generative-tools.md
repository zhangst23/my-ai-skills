### Choosing a Voice Tool

```
Need voiceover for ads?
├── Need to clone a specific brand voice?
│   ├── Best quality → ElevenLabs
│   ├── Enterprise/on-premise → Resemble AI
│   └── Budget-friendly → Fish Audio, PlayHT
├── Need multilingual (same ad, many languages)?
│   ├── Most languages → PlayHT (140+)
│   └── Best quality → ElevenLabs (29+)
├── Need free / open source / local?
│   └── Voicebox (MIT, runs on your machine)
├── Need cheap, fast, good-enough?
│   └── OpenAI TTS ($0.015/min)
├── Need commercially-safe licensing?
│   └── WellSaid Labs (actor-compensated voices)
└── Need real-time/interactive?
    └── Cartesia Sonic (40ms TTFA)
```

### Workflow: Voice + Video

```
1. Write ad script (use ad-creative skill for copy)
2. Generate voiceover with ElevenLabs/OpenAI TTS
3. Generate or render video:
   a. Silent video from Runway/Remotion → layer voice track
   b. Or use Veo/Sora/Seedance with native audio (skip separate VO)
4. Combine with ffmpeg if layering separately:
   ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i voiceover.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mp4
5. Generate variations (different scripts, voices, or languages)
```

## Code-Based Video: Remotion

For templated, data-driven video ads at scale, Remotion is the best option. Unlike AI video generators that produce unique video from prompts, Remotion uses React code to render deterministic, brand-perfect video from templates and data.

**Best for:** Templated ad variations, personalized video, brand-consistent production
**Stack:** React + TypeScript
**Pricing:** Free for individuals/small teams; commercial license required for 4+ employees
**Docs:** [remotion.dev](https://www.remotion.dev/)

### Why Remotion for Ads

| AI Video Generators | Remotion |
|---------------------|----------|
| Unique output each time | Deterministic, pixel-perfect |
| Prompt-based, less control | Full code control over every frame |
| Hard to match brand exactly | Exact brand colors, fonts, spacing |
| One-at-a-time generation | Batch render hundreds from data |
| No dynamic data insertion | Personalize with names, prices, stats |

### Ad Creative Use Cases

**1. Dynamic product ads**
Feed a JSON array of products and render a unique video ad for each:
```tsx
// Simplified Remotion component for product ads
export const ProductAd: React.FC<{
  productName: string;
  price: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  tagline: string;
}> = ({productName, price, imageUrl, tagline}) => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill style={{backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Img src={imageUrl} style={{width: 400, height: 400}} />
      <h1>{productName}</h1>
      <p>{tagline}</p>
      <div className="price">{price}</div>
      <div className="cta">Shop Now</div>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

**2. A/B test video variations**
Render the same template with different headlines, CTAs, or color schemes:
```tsx
const variations = [
  {headline: "Save 50% Today", cta: "Get the Deal", theme: "urgent"},
  {headline: "Join 10K+ Teams", cta: "Start Free", theme: "social-proof"},
  {headline: "Built for Speed", cta: "Try It Now", theme: "benefit"},
];
// Render all variations programmatically
```

**3. Personalized outreach videos**
Generate videos addressing prospects by name for cold outreach or sales.

**4. Social ad batch production**
Render the same content across different aspect ratios:
- 1:1 for feed
- 9:16 for Stories/Reels
- 16:9 for YouTube

### Remotion Workflow for Ad Creative

```
1. Design template in React (or use AI to generate the component)
2. Define data schema (products, headlines, CTAs, images)
3. Feed data array into template
4. Batch render all variations
5. Upload to ad platform
```

### Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new Remotion project
npx create-video@latest

# Render a single video
npx remotion render src/index.ts MyComposition out/video.mp4

# Batch render from data
npx remotion render src/index.ts MyComposition --props='{"data": [...]}'
```

## Choosing the Right Tool

### Decision Tree

```
Need video ads?
├── Templated, data-driven (same structure, different data)
│   └── Use Remotion
├── Unique creative from prompts (exploratory)
│   ├── Need dialogue/voiceover? → Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Kling 2.6, Seedance 2.0
│   ├── Need consistency across scenes? → Runway Gen-4
│   ├── Need vertical social video? → Veo 3.1 (native 9:16)
│   ├── Need high volume at low cost? → Seedance 2.0
│   └── Need cinematic camera work? → Higgsfield, Kling
└── Both → Use AI gen for hero creative, Remotion for variations

Need image ads?
├── Need text/headlines in image? → Ideogram
├── Need product consistency across variations? → Flux (multi-ref)
├── Need quick iterations on existing images? → Nano Banana Pro
├── Need highest visual quality? → Flux Pro, Midjourney
└── Need high volume at low cost? → Flux Klein, Nano Banana
```

### Cost Comparison for 100 Ad Variations

| Approach | Tool | Approximate Cost |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 100 static images | Nano Banana Pro | ~$4-24 |
| 100 static images | Flux Dev | ~$1-2 |
| 100 static images | Ideogram API | ~$6 |
| 100 × 15-sec videos | Veo 3.1 Fast | ~$225 |
| 100 × 15-sec videos | Remotion (templated) | ~$0 (self-hosted render) |
| 10 hero videos + 90 templated | Veo + Remotion | ~$22 + render time |

### Recommended Workflow for Scaled Ad Production

1. **Generate hero creative** with AI (Nano Banana, Flux, Veo) — high-quality, exploratory
2. **Build templates** in Remotion based on winning creative patterns
3. **Batch produce variations** with Remotion using data (products, headlines, CTAs)
4. **Iterate** — use AI tools for new angles, Remotion for scale

This hybrid approach gives you the creative exploration of AI generators and the consistency and scale of code-based rendering.

## Platform-Specific Image Specs

When generating images for ads, request the correct dimensions:

| Platform | Placement | Aspect Ratio | Recommended Size |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Meta Feed | Single image | 1:1 | 1080x1080 |
| Meta Stories/Reels | Vertical | 9:16 | 1080x1920 |
| Meta Carousel | Square | 1:1 | 1080x1080 |
| Google Display | Landscape | 1.91:1 | 1200x628 |
| Google Display | Square | 1:1 | 1200x1200 |
| LinkedIn Feed | Landscape | 1.91:1 | 1200x627 |
| LinkedIn Feed | Square | 1:1 | 1200x1200 |
| TikTok Feed | Vertical | 9:16 | 1080x1920 |
| Twitter/X Feed | Landscape | 16:9 | 1200x675 |
| Twitter/X Card | Landscape | 1.91:1 | 800x418 |

Include these dimensions in your generation prompts to avoid needing to crop or resize.
