## Google Ads

### Responsive Search Ads (RSAs)

| Element | Character Limit | Required | Notes |
|---------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Headline | 30 chars | 3 minimum, 15 max | Any 3 may be shown together |
| Description | 90 chars | 2 minimum, 4 max | Any 2 may be shown together |
| Display path 1 | 15 chars | Optional | Appears after domain in URL |
| Display path 2 | 15 chars | Optional | Appears after path 1 |
| Final URL | No limit | Required | Landing page URL |

**Combination rules:**
- Google selects up to 3 headlines and 2 descriptions to show
- Headlines appear separated by " | " or stacked
- Any headline can appear in any position unless pinned
- Pinning reduces Google's ability to optimize — use sparingly

**Pinning strategy:**
- Pin your brand name to position 1 if brand guidelines require it
- Pin your strongest CTA to position 2 or 3
- Leave most headlines unpinned for machine learning

**Headline mix recommendation (15 headlines):**
- 3-4 keyword-focused (match search intent)
- 3-4 benefit-focused (what they get)
- 2-3 social proof (numbers, awards, customers)
- 2-3 CTA-focused (action to take)
- 1-2 differentiators (why you over competitors)
- 1 brand name headline

**Description mix recommendation (4 descriptions):**
- 1 benefit + proof point
- 1 feature + outcome
- 1 social proof + CTA
- 1 urgency/offer + CTA (if applicable)

## Character Counting Tips

- **Spaces count** as characters on all platforms
- **Emojis** count as 1-2 characters depending on platform
- **Special characters** (|, &, etc.) count as 1 character
- **URLs** in body text count against limits
- **Dynamic keyword insertion** (`{KeyWord:default}`) can exceed limits — set safe defaults
- Always verify in the platform's ad preview before launching

## Multi-Platform Creative Adaptation

When creating for multiple platforms simultaneously, start with the most restrictive format:

1. **Google Search headlines** (30 chars) — forces the tightest messaging
2. **Expand to Meta headlines** (40 chars) — add a word or two
3. **Expand to LinkedIn intro text** (150 chars) — add context and proof
4. **Expand to Meta primary text** (125+ chars) — full hook and value prop

This cascading approach ensures your core message works everywhere, then gets enriched for platforms that allow more space.
