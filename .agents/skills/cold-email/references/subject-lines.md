# Subject Line Optimization

The subject line determines whether the email gets read. The data is counterintuitive: **short, boring, internal-looking subject lines win decisively.**

## Length: 2–4 words

- 2-word subject lines get **60% more opens** than 5-word (Lavender).
- Going from 2 to 4 words reduces replies by **17.5%**.
- 2–4 words yield **46% open rates** vs 34% for 10 words (Belkins, 5.5M emails).
- Mobile truncates at 30–35 characters — brevity is practical necessity.

## Internal Camouflage Principle

Subject lines that look like they came from a colleague, not a vendor, double open rates (Gong). Buyers mentally categorize before opening — if it looks like sales, it's filtered.

**High-performing examples:** "reply rates" · "trial delays" · "hiring ops" · "employee turnover" · "Q2 forecast" · "new patients" · "personalization issue" · "second page"

## Capitalization: lowercase wins

All-lowercase has highest open rates (Gong, 85M+ emails). Lowercase looks more personal/internal. For cold outreach specifically, lowercase beats title case.

## Personalization: context over name

Personalized subject lines boost opens **26–50%**, but type matters:

- **First name in subject line → 12% fewer replies.** Signals automation.
- **Contextual personalization works:** pain points, competitors, trigger events, industry challenges.
- Use {{painPoint}}, {{competitor}}, {{commonGround}} — not {{firstName}}.

## Questions: only when highly specific

Data conflicts: Belkins says questions perform well (46% open rate). Lavender says questions lower opens by **56%**. Resolution: **specific pain questions work** ("Need help with {{challenge}}?"), **generic questions fail** ("Quick question?" / "Have 15 minutes?"). Default to statements.

## What to Avoid

| Anti-pattern                                   | Impact                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Salesy language ("increase," "boost," "ROI")   | -17.9% opens                |
| Urgency words ("ASAP," "urgent")               | Below 36% opens             |
| Excessive punctuation ("!!!" or "??")          | -36% opens                  |
| Numbers and percentages                        | -46% opens                  |
| Emojis                                         | Hurt B2B professionalism    |
| Pitching product in subject                    | -57% replies                |
| Empty/no subject line                          | +30% opens but -12% replies |
| Spam triggers ("free," "guarantee," "act now") | Deliverability risk         |

## C-Suite Subject Lines

Executives receive 300–400 emails daily, decide in seconds. They respond **23% more often** than non-C-suite when emails pass their filter (6.4% reply rate).

What works: ultra-concise, human, understated. "{{companyInitiative}}" · "thank you" · "an update" · "a question" · reference to a specific project or trigger event.

Anything "salesy" is immediately rejected.
