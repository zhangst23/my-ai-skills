# Personalization at Scale

Personalization drives **50–250% more replies** (Lavender). The key insight: **if your personalization has nothing to do with the problem you solve, it's just an attention hack** (Clay).

## Four Levels of Personalization

### Level 1 — Basic (merge tags)

First name, company name, job title. Table stakes, no longer differentiating. ~5% lift.

### Level 2 — Industry/segment

Industry-specific pain points, trends, regulatory challenges. Scalable via micro-segmentation.

> Most {{industry}} teams struggle with {{lead gen problem}}, which often leads to wasted effort.

### Level 3 — Role-level

Challenges specific to their role and seniority.

> As Head of Sales, keeping pipeline steady is probably your biggest headache. Your RevOps team is small, so you're likely wearing multiple hats during scaling.

### Level 4 — Individual (gold standard)

Specific, timely observations about that person connected to the problem you solve.

> Noticed you're hiring 3 SDRs — sounds like you're scaling outbound fast. Most teams hit follow-up fatigue during onboarding.

## Research Signal Stack

| LinkedIn activity | Posts, comments, job changes       | "Really enjoyed your post about X"                                           |

## The 3-Minute Personalization System

From "30 Minutes to President's Club":

**Step 1:** Build a research stack of top 10 buying signals — 5 company triggers, 5 person triggers. Stack-rank by relevance.

**Step 2:** Build a 3x3 template: (1) personalization attached to a problem, (2) problem you solve, (3) one-sentence solution + low-friction CTA.

**Step 3:** Create 5 "trigger templates" — pre-written personalization paragraphs for each trigger, with a smooth segue into the problem.

The personalization must logically connect to the problem. This creates 5 reusable triggers with the rest of the email constant. A top SDR writes a personalized email in **under 3 minutes**.

## The Four -Graphic Principles (Becc Holland)

- **Demographic** — Age, profession, background
- **Technographic** — Tech stack, tools used
- **Firmographic** — Company size, funding, industry, growth stage
- **Psychographic** — Values, passions, beliefs (highest-impact dimension)

Tapping into what prospects are passionate about drives significantly higher response rates.

## Observation-Based Openers (highest performing)

**Trigger-event:** "Congrats on the recent funding round — scaling the team from here is exciting, and I imagine [challenge] is top of mind."

**Observation:** "Your recent post about [topic] resonated — especially the part about [detail]. Got me thinking about how that applies to [challenge]."

**Industry insight:** "Most [role titles] I talk to spend [X hours/week] on [problem] — curious if that matches your experience at [Company]."

## What Feels Fake (avoid)

- AI-generated emails with similar phrasing ("I hope this email finds you well")
- Generic attention hacks disconnected from problem ("Cool that you went to UCLA!" → pitch)
- Over-personalizing to creepiness
- "I saw your LinkedIn profile and wanted to reach out" — signals mass automation

## The "So What?" Test

After writing any opening line, read from prospect's perspective: "So what? Why would I care?" If the answer is nothing, rewrite.
