# Follow-Up Sequences

55% of replies come from follow-ups, not the initial email. Yet 48% of salespeople never follow up even once.

## How Many: 3–5 Total Emails

- Highest single-email reply rate: **8.4%** (Belkins).
- 4–7 email campaigns achieve **27% reply rates** vs 9% for 1–3 emails (Woodpecker, 20M emails).
- By 4th follow-up, response rates drop **55%** and spam complaints **triple**.
- Resolution: longer sequences catch different timing windows. Cap at 4 follow-ups (5 total emails). Each must add genuinely new value.

## Optimal Cadence

Increase the gap between each touch:

| Touch         | Day   | Notes                                          |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Initial email | 0     | Maximum personalization investment             |
| Follow-up 1   | 3     | Waiting 3 days increases response by up to 31% |
| Follow-up 2   | 7–8   | Different angle                                |
| Follow-up 3   | 14    | New value piece                                |
| Follow-up 4   | 21–28 | Breakup email                                  |

**Best days:** Tuesday–Thursday (Thursday peaks at 6.87% reply rate).
**Best times:** 9–11 AM or 1–3 PM in prospect's local time.
**Avoid:** Monday mornings (inbox overload), Friday afternoons (checked out).

## Angle Rotation

Each follow-up must stand alone while building toward the goal. Never just "bump this up."

| Email       | Angle                                                      | Purpose                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Initial     | Personalized hook + core value prop + soft CTA             | Introduce problem/solution |
| Follow-up 1 | Different angle, new value piece (stat, insight, resource) | Show additional benefit    |
| Follow-up 2 | Social proof / case study from similar company             | Build credibility          |
| Follow-up 3 | New insight, industry trend, or relevant resource          | Demonstrate expertise      |
| Follow-up 4 | Breakup — acknowledge silence, leave door open             | Trigger loss aversion      |

Add only **one new value proposition per email** (SalesBread). This naturally forces different angles.

## The Breakup Email

Leverages loss aversion — removing pressure while creating scarcity through withdrawal. Close.com reports **10–15% response rates** from breakup emails with cold prospects.

**Structure:**

1. Acknowledge you've reached out multiple times
2. Validate their potential lack of interest
3. State this is your final email for now
4. Leave the door open

**Example:**

> I haven't heard back, so I'll assume now isn't the right time. Before I close the loop: [1-sentence insight or resource]. If that changes things, feel free to reply. Otherwise, no hard feelings — good luck with [their goal].

**1-2-3 Format** (reduces friction to near zero):

> Since I haven't heard back, I'll keep it simple. Reply with a number:
>
> 1 — Interested, let's talk
> 2 — Not now, check back in 3 months
> 3 — Not interested, please stop

**Critical rule:** If you send a breakup email, honor it. Do not contact the prospect again.

## Phrases That Kill Response Rates

- "I never heard back" → **12% drop** in meeting booking rate (Gong)
- "Just checking in" → Zero value, signals laziness
- "Bumping this to the top of your inbox" → Presumptuous
- "Did you see my last email?" → Guilt-tripping
- "Following up on my previous message" → Generic, adds nothing

## CTA Adjustment by Seniority

**Executives/founders:** Ultra-low-effort, curiosity-driven. "Curious?" or "Worth 2 min?"

**Mid-level managers:** More specific value. "Want me to walk through how [Company] saved 15 hours/week?"

Higher in the org chart = less friction you can ask for.
