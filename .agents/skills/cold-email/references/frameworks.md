# Cold Email Copywriting Frameworks

Frameworks beat templates — they teach thinking patterns, not copy-paste shortcuts.

## PAS — Problem, Agitate, Solution (default)

**Structure:** Identify pain → Amplify consequences → Present solution + soft CTA.
**Best for:** Problem-aware but not solution-aware prospects. The workhorse framework.

> Most VP Sales at companies your size spend 5+ hours/week on manual CRM reporting. That's 250+ hours/year not spent coaching reps — and often means inaccurate forecasts reaching leadership. We built a tool that auto-generates CRM reports in real time. Teams like Datadog reduced reporting time by 80%. Would it make sense to see how?

## BAB — Before, After, Bridge

**Structure:** Current painful situation → Ideal future → Your product as the bridge.
**Best for:** Transformation-driven offers with clear before/after. Emotional decision-makers.

> Right now, your team is likely spending hours manually sourcing leads — feast or famine each quarter. Imagine qualified leads arriving daily on autopilot, reps spending 100% of their time selling. That's what our platform does. Companies like HubSpot saw a 40% pipeline increase within 90 days. Can I show you how?

## QVC — Question, Value, CTA

**Structure:** Targeted pain question → Brief value → Direct next step.
**Best for:** C-suite prospects who prefer brevity. Qualify interest immediately.

> Are your SDRs spending more time researching than selling? We help sales teams automate prospect research so reps focus on conversations. Clients see 3x more meetings per rep per week. Worth a 10-minute demo?

## AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action

**Structure:** Hook/stat → Address specific challenge → Social proof/outcome → Clear CTA.
**Best for:** Data-driven prospects, high-ticket pitches with strong stats.

> Companies in pharma lose 30% of leads due to manual outreach. Given {{Company}}'s growth this quarter, pipeline velocity is likely top of mind. Customers like Pfizer use our platform to automate lead qualification — cutting time-to-contact by 60%. Worth a 15-minute call?

## PPP — Praise, Picture, Push

**Structure:** Genuine compliment → How things could be better → Gentle push to action.
**Best for:** Senior prospects who respond to relationship-building. Requires genuine trigger.

> Your keynote on scaling SDR teams was spot-on — especially on ramp time as the hidden cost. What if you could cut that in half? Our in-inbox coach helps new reps write effective emails from day one with real-time scoring. Open to a quick chat about how this could support your growth?

## Star-Story-Solution

**Structure:** Introduce character (customer) → Tell challenge narrative → Reveal results.
**Best for:** Strong customer success stories. Humanizes the pitch.

> Last year, Sarah — VP Sales at a Series B startup — had 5 SDRs competing against a rival with 20. Her team was getting crushed on volume. They adopted our AI prospecting tool and sent hyper-personalized emails at 3x pace without losing quality. Within 90 days, they booked more meetings than their competitor's entire team. Happy to share how this could work for {{Company}}.

## SCQ — Situation, Complication, Question

**Structure:** Current reality → Complicating challenge → Question that speaks to need → Optional answer.
**Best for:** Consultative selling. Mirrors how professionals present to leadership.

> Your team doubled this year. That usually means onboarding is eating into selling time. How are you handling ramp for new hires?

## ACCA — Awareness, Comprehension, Conviction, Action

**Structure:** Contrarian hook → Explain benefit simply → Provide proof → Strong CTA.
**Best for:** Analytical buyers who need evidence (engineers, CFOs, ops leaders).

> Most sales teams measure rep activity. The top 5% measure rep efficiency instead. When Acme switched, they booked 40% more meetings with fewer emails. Worth seeing how?

## 3C's (Alex Berman)

**Structure:** Compliment → Case Study → CTA.
**Best for:** Agency/services cold outreach. Case study does the heavy lifting.

> Big fan of [Company]. We just built an app for [Competitor] that does XYZ. I have a few more ideas. Interested?

## Mouse Trap (Lavender/Will Allred)

**Structure:** Observation + Binary value-prop question. 1–2 sentences total.
**Best for:** Maximum brevity. Impulsive reply based on curiosity.

> Looks like you're hiring reps. Would it be helpful to get a more granular look at how they're ramping on email?

## Justin Michael Method

**Structure:** Trigger/Pain → Solution hint → Binary CTA. 1–3 sentences, no intro.
**Best for:** High-velocity SDR teams. Mobile-optimized. Deliberately polarizing.

Spend max 1 minute on personalization. Use industry/persona-level signals. For top-tier prospects, quote their own words from interviews — they almost always respond.

## Vanilla Ice Cream (Lavender)

**Structure:** Observation → Problem/Insight → Credibility → Solution → Call-to-Conversation.
**Best for:** Universal "base" framework that works everywhere. Five parts.

## PASTOR (Ray Edwards)

**Structure:** Problem → Amplify → Story → Testimony → Offer → Response.
**Best for:** Longer-form or multi-email sequences. Consulting, education, complex B2B services. Each element can be developed across separate touches.
