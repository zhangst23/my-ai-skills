## Incentive Sizing Framework

**Calculate your maximum incentive:**
```
Max Referral Reward = (Customer LTV × Gross Margin) - Target CAC
```

**Example:**
- LTV: $1,200
- Gross margin: 70%
- Target CAC: $200
- Max reward: ($1,200 × 0.70) - $200 = $640

**Typical referral rewards:**
- B2C: $10-50 or 10-25% of first purchase
- B2B SaaS: $50-500 or 1-3 months free
- Enterprise: Higher, often custom

## Viral Coefficient & Metrics

### Key Metrics

**Viral coefficient (K-factor):**
```
K = Invitations × Conversion Rate

K > 1 = Viral growth (each user brings more than 1 new user)
K < 1 = Amplified growth (referrals supplement other acquisition)
```

**Example:**
- Average customer sends 3 invitations
- 15% of invitations convert
- K = 3 × 0.15 = 0.45

**Referral rate:**
```
Referral Rate = (Customers who refer) / (Total customers)
```

Benchmarks:
- Good: 10-25% of customers refer
- Great: 25-50%
- Exceptional: 50%+

**Referrals per referrer:**

Benchmarks:
- Average: 1-2 referrals per referrer
- Good: 2-5
- Exceptional: 5+

### Calculating Referral Program ROI

```
Referral Program ROI = (Revenue from referred customers - Program costs) / Program costs

Program costs = Rewards paid + Tool costs + Management time
```

**Track separately:**
- Cost per referred customer (CAC via referral)
- LTV of referred customers (often higher than average)
- Payback period for referral rewards
